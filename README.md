## The part about limited rights in my country

This part has been written in 2023/11.

Instead of emphasis on the idea, that we are fighting for freedom, our government had closed borders for men to keep them inside the country as potential soldiers. Formally, it is legal according to the **European Convention on Human Rights**, but it's still a rights limiting.

<img src="https://github.com/hirve/important-notice/blob/main/echr-art-4.png" alt="ECHR Article 4" width="50%">

Translation from the official language into human-understandable language:

> Slavery is not slavery <sup>[1984]</sup>

The fact that an innocent person is limited in movement is a strong demotivating factor. The fact that a group of people has limited rights is real discrimination.

Restrictions on our rights became a strong impetus to a new wave of corruption. This provoked an incredible sense of injustice in some parts of society. Participants of corruption schemes who have money and are ready to act illegally have gone abroad. And the representatives of the authorities themselves have an unlimited opportunity to leave the country.

Slavery remains slavery. It doesn't matter that it is legal, consider that in all societies where slavery existed, it was legal.

I think that the Trust is the real engine for modern relations between government and society and this can do more than forced labor, limited rights and discrimination. We need real Freedom. We are fighting for Freedom.
